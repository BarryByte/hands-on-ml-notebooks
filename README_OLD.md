### Case Studies

#### [Delhivery – Feature Engineering](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B5GrtdftOoL-DhUXrg8lhJuFjl5iNzES?usp=sharing)
Delhivery is a leading logistics company in India aiming to build a data-driven operational system for commerce. This case study involves:
- Data cleaning and feature engineering to extract useful insights from raw logistics data.
- Aggregating trip-level details and analyzing factors like time and distance metrics.
- Handling categorical variables, outliers, and missing values for predictive modeling.

#### [Jamboree Education – Linear Regression](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q4zhkvtoeFUbLqU5AJ9NBC_4pwp3Rp2C)
Jamboree, a test preparation leader, launched a tool to predict Ivy League admission chances. This case study includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand relationships among factors like GRE scores, TOEFL scores, GPA, and admission chances.
- Building and evaluating a linear regression model to predict admission probability.
- Validating model assumptions and providing actionable insights for improvement.

#### [Ola Cabs – Ensemble Learning](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zLjsvStKUqwlcRDdcgFS2imIBuT6CV3X)
Ola Cabs is focused on driver attrition and retention. This case study involves:
- Predicting whether a driver will leave the company using attributes like demographics, tenure, and performance data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis to derive insights from attributes such as age, income, and ratings.
- Feature engineering steps like creating target variables, handling missing values with KNN imputation, and addressing class imbalance.
- Implementing ensemble learning techniques (Bagging and Boosting) for predictive modeling.
- Evaluating results with metrics such as Classification Report and ROC AUC Curve, and providing actionable business insights.

#### [Yulu – Hypothesis Testing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t00v6mS_b8P-mXUggPZfEVRymH2s5Hp2?usp=sharing)
Yulu is a micro-mobility service provider that faced revenue dips. This case study focuses on:
- Exploring factors influencing demand for shared electric cycles, such as weather, working days, and seasons.
- Using hypothesis testing techniques like 2-sample t-tests, ANNOVA, and Chi-square tests.
- Performing EDA to identify patterns in attributes like humidity, temperature, and user counts.
- Evaluating test assumptions and interpreting statistical significance to draw business insights.
- Deriving actionable recommendations to address revenue challenges.
